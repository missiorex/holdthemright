Every child is a gift from heaven and every parent is a caretaker of this great gift. Ideally every father and mother is responsible to help their children to find their God given vocation.

As we live in a fallen world, the challenges are many but Godâ€™s grace is sufficient to take us through. Just the other day happened to see a video about  of the most famous rock star Michael Jackson... He was fifth among the five boys in a Negro family. His mother was first to recognise his skill but on growing up he distanced himself from family and spend most of his wealth in changing his body to a white one. The very reason for this was the way his father treated him. Micheal said all this was an answer to his father who used to ridicule his appearance. How sad that though born in a big family he could not experience the love of God.. Though acclaimed by millions he was not able to accept himself. Just how powerful is each word that we speak to our children. They can be made into beasts or angels simply by our words..

So then how important is our role in their lives... How important to hold them right, that they reflect the perfect image of Christ.

Hold em right is a humble initiative of Prakash & Nisha, a catholic couple from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. Here we talk about our experiences, learnings, failures and success in parenting and our faith journey. Hope it encourages you too..
