Every child is a gift from heaven and every parent is a caretaker of this great gift. Ideally every father and mother is responsible to help their children to find their God given vocation.

As we live in a fallen world, the challenges are many but God’s grace is sufficient to take us through all the tough challenges of parenthood we parents face.

We find the meaning and purpose of everything in our lives…relationships, values in Jesus. When we hold them right, we reflect the perfect image of Christ in our lives.

Hold em right is a humble initiative of Prakash & Nisha, a catholic couple from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. Here we talk about our experiences, learnings, failures and success in parenting and our faith journey.
